# calculator
this is a code to calculate the addition,substract,multiply and divide of any two rational numbers to give a rational number

This console application is based on storing rational numbers in char arrays so that size limitation of float or any data type which is used to store rational numbers is escaped and also the limitation of accuracy ,in other words it gives answer with infinite accuracy 

sub and multiplication functions are now complete and division functions are not yet present.
the present add and sub functions are only disignned to take only those rational numbers whose decimal part is not reapeting.for example "6.57(9086)" now in this number's decimal part there is a pair of brackets which means that ,the "9086" in the bracket keeps on reapeating to infinity.
that is  6.57908690869086908690869086 and so on.
such numbers are not yet designned in understandstrings() function.
